1: I used a pritn function to print the given parameter
2: i opened the file then used readlines() to create the list. THen i used a for loop to get rid of the \n at the end of each string in the list
3: I made the first string into a list, changed the value of the list at the index given to the second string, then joined the list back int a string
4: I used a for loop to check if the current value was equal to the strinng and if it was I increased my count variable
5: I checked if either the capitalized version or lowercase version of the string was in the first list. Then I printed that out as well as the value in list two with the same index
6: I added the two lists
7: I used a for loop to check if each value in list one was in list two then appended it two a new list if it was
8: same as 7 but i checked if they were not in the second list
